            always at risk with any investment and past performance is not a guarantee for future
            performances. We would hereby also not be liable for any loss that occurs from acts, events or
            circumstances not reasonably within our control, including but not limited to force, economic

        <h1>ON TERMINATION OF INVESTMENT</h1>
        <p>
            Termination of an investment plan or package means that you accept to forfeit 20% of your initial
            investment if it has not generated any ROI, and if you have generated any ROI, then PAID ROI30%(minus) is what you get. This is because the funds are being used and immediate
            termination or cancellation of your investment capital would incur some loss.
